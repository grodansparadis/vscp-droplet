  curl 192.168.43.130:80/hello
  curl -X POST --data-binary @registers.txt 192.168.1.112:80/echo > tmpfile
  curl -X PUT -d "0" 192.168.1.112:80/ctrl
  curl -X PUT -d "1" 192.168.1.112:80/ctrl

  1. "curl 192.168.43.130:80/hello"  - tests the GET "\hello" handler
  2. "curl -X POST --data-binary @anyfile 192.168.43.130:80/echo > tmpfile"
      * "anyfile" is the file being sent as request body and "tmpfile" is where the body of the response is saved
      * since the server echoes back the request body, the two files should be same, as can be confirmed using : "cmp anyfile tmpfile"
  3. "curl -X PUT -d "0" 192.168.43.130:80/ctrl" - disable /hello and /echo handlers
  4. "curl -X PUT -d "1" 192.168.43.130:80/ctrl" -  enable /hello and /echo handlers
